# inverter

- Design: none (a Track P item on T4's one-thread row); experiments in
  `docs/perf/inverter.md`, each written before it runs. Owner direction (2026-10-17, through
  the lead): for every cost, try at least one mechanism neither Lucene nor Tantivy uses
  (sort-based inversion, batch SIMD analysis, arena layouts that make flush a copy), and
  build the winners of the research note `docs/research/indexing.md` (branch
  `research/indexing`) as it lands.
- Branch / worktree: `perf/inverter` at `/Users/kronuz/code/Kronuz/strata-wt/inverter`, from
  `origin/main` at `4c9ebfd`.
- Scope: the one-thread document path (the engine's parse and tokenize, stage 1, the
  buffer) and the flush's inversion and encoding. Out of scope: eight-thread scaling
  (`perf/indexing-gap`), index size and merging (`perf/index-size`).
- State: implementing (E0, the profile).
- Done criteria (set by the lead; contributors tick, never edit): none set yet.
- Done:
  - Worktree, Release build with frame pointers (`.scratch/build-rel`), the first 100,000
    documents of the gate corpus copied from the gate VM (`.scratch/corpus`, sha256
    `0a1d5344…acebd`, equal to the VM's `head -100000 corpus.json`).
- Doing: E0 on macOS: the 20,000-document dry run, then `sample` over the 100,000-document
  run, attributed by phase.
- Next:
  1. E0 on Linux in the gate VM (`perf record -g`) once the T3 run and the indexing gap's
     strict hold release it.
  2. Calibrate Tantivy-0.26-st (the anchor) and strata at 100,000 documents on both
     platforms.
  3. The first experiment against E0's largest cost, written into the perf file first.
- Blocked on: nothing.
- Findings folded in: none yet.
- Last verified: 2026-10-17, `strata_engine` builds at `4c9ebfd` (Apple clang 17, Release,
  `-march=native -g -fno-omit-frame-pointer`).
