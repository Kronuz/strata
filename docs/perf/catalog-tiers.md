# The cold tier's gate rows through the catalog

`bench/catalog_tiers` measures `docs/design/cold-tier.md`'s T1 to T4 and T2d as a host runs the
catalog: a `catalog<kv_index>` over `PosixIO` directories that `idle_index build` makes, a
`work_pool_executor` (eight chores at once), a timer thread, one shared `reader_registry`, and the
process's real `resource_budget`, which raises `RLIMIT_NOFILE` to its hard limit and caps from it.
`bench/catalog_tiers/tiers.sh` builds this tree's harness beside `main`'s `idle_index`, the
re-measured baseline (A3), and runs each row with the baseline interleaved in the same job.

## How each row runs

- **Tiers.** Hot is every index opened by `try_pin` (eager segments, so every segment mapped);
  warm is `begin_demote()` on each slot (`open` with nothing mapped, or `owed` under `defer_io`);
  cold is demoted then `begin_close()`d, so no slot holds it. The sweep is not started, so nothing
  moves a slot between forcing and measuring.
- **T1** meters the process as `idle_index` does (resident, footprint, descriptors, mappings)
  after a 5 s idle, and the counting build (`catalog_tiers_count`, `bench/idle_index/heap_count.hh`)
  gives the live heap per index.
- **T2 and T2d** take one request pin and one `get` per index in a random order from one thread off
  the pool. A warm `defer_io` index's pin starts the wake, `promote()` runs on the pool, and the pin
  resumes on the requesting thread; a cold one's pin posts the open to the same pool. Under
  `defer_io` the run then times `promote()` alone on 10,000 indexes opened without the catalog,
  per segment, against D3's 33 to 50 µs estimate.
- **T3** starts the sweep with the row's caps, gets every index once on 8 threads, then 1M Zipf
  requests at θ = 0.99. A sampler reads the kernel every second: mappings and descriptors, and on
  macOS this process's vnodes (the distinct files behind its descriptors and mapped regions;
  `kern.num_vnodes` is the system's vnode cache, which sits at `kern.maxvnodes`, 263,168 here, on a
  busy host, so it is reported, not compared). The row passes on zero `ENFILE`, `EMFILE`, `ENOMEM`
  and `too_many_open`, every peak below the budget's hard caps, and open and hot counts within one
  pass (`pass_posts`, 16) of the soft caps 3 s after the requests end.
- **T4** replays `test/s3fifo_model.hh`'s trace (mt19937_64 seeded 42; the scan variant inserts one
  access to every key after the warm-up) on 8 threads from one cursor, each request a pin by key
  and a re-pin by handle. The hit ratio over the measured part is one less the misses (opens of an
  absent key, reopens of a closing one, retries) over the requests; the models (`s8_variants` and
  `model_total`) replay the same trace at the catalog's `soft_open`. The row passes at the
  `s8_variants` ratio less one point with no kernel error.

## Commands

```sh
tiers.sh build OUT MAIN_SRC 100000 1000000   # light: binaries and fixtures
tiers.sh smoke OUT                           # strict, under 3 minutes
tiers.sh t1 OUT d1s1 100000 3                # strict, per fixture: d1s1 d100s1 d1000s1 d100s10 d1000s10
tiers.sh t2 OUT d1000s10 100000 1 [drop]     # strict, per fixture: d1s1 d1000s1 d1000s10
tiers.sh t3 OUT 1000000                      # strict (macOS) or the gate VM (Linux)
tiers.sh t4 OUT 0.99 [scan]                  # and 1.2: four cells
```

A one-document index has one segment, so the 10-segment fixtures carry 100 and 1,000 documents.

## Findings while building it

- **Every open syncs twice.** `basic_index::open` syncs the directory and then the manifest log
  (`index.hh`, the rollover's D6.6 rule), on `main` too. On the development Mac under other jobs'
  load, a sample of `idle_index open` spent nearly all its time in those two `fcntl` calls, and
  opens took 25 to 60 ms each. T2's cold row, T3's touch and T4's misses pay it per open.
